<h3>A little about me:</h3>
<p>My name is Num0Programmer, and I have been around the sun, about, 18 times since I was born. During my orbits, a love for programming
  has blosomed inside of me. Most of my efforts have been focused on game development, so I am studying Computer Science at Northern Arizona
  University to better myself as a Software Engineer.</p>

<h2>Why this website exists:</h2>
<p>If you have found this website via my LinkedIn, Congratulations! This website exists so I have an easy way of making the projects I have created
  available to you, and so you have an easy way to access these projects over and over.</p>
<p>If you just happened on this website, Congratulations to you as well! Now you have access to all the games I put up on this website. Hope you
  enjoy playing them!</p>

<h1>What I am currently working on:</h1>

- "Runni Boi" is a game in the works at the moment. The game is has a Level 1 to Level Nth structure. The goal of the game is for the player to
  explore the level and find the marker, which appears in each level. Finding this marker will complete the leve. The game is based around movement,
  so the player is highly encouraged to take advantage of the physics to move around the world.

<h3>What is in the near future for Runni Boi?</h3>
<p>In the future, the game will have equipment to collect. The player can explore the world and find equipable piece such as thrusters to
   help them get around the map easier. However, the player is welcome to skip over these augments and go for a purely base movement approach.
   For this type of player, I plan to create a leveling system which a player is able to increase their abilities, such as Stamina, to help
   them move around the map. However, there will be some disadvantages to this approach, but, hopefully, by taking this challenge I can offer
   players them something in return through the gameplay.</p>

<h1>Future projects:</h1>
- "Run and Gun" is a game I plan to begin shortly to try my hand at a multiplayer game. The goal of the game will be to have fun with friends in
  either a Team Deathmatch or Free-for-All match setup.

<h4>How I plan to start "Run and Gun":</h4>
<p>I have recently created a base movement script I am happy with; I plan to use this as a way to get player movement off the table when I first
   start the project. I would like to add sliding and wall running, or at least wall jumping, to make the combat a little more exciting and give
   players options for how they want to engage their enemies in combat.</p>
